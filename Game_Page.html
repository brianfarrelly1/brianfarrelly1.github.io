	<p>In a research facility on Mars owned by the Union Aerospace Corporation, facility director Samuel Hayden's mind now inhabits an android body after having lost his original to brain cancer. Researchers attempted to draw energy from Hell in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from Hell. Hayden has already led multiple expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. One artifact was a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his Praetor Suit), whom the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.
	The facility has been invaded by demons after one of UAC's scientists, Olivia Pierce, made a pact with them and opened a portal to Hell.

	<p>The events in Arkham Origins take place about five years before Batman: Arkham Asylum, in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an experienced crime-fighter in the second year of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes.</p><br>

	<p>The game is inspired by such classic titles as Quake, DOOM and Serious Sam, with the emphasis on killing large numbers of monsters. The game is divided into five chapters, each about five levels long. The player's objective is to get through each level, from start to finish, by slaughtering hundreds of monsters. One of the game's most important aspects is its diversity. Each level presents a new location with various themes and graphic styles. The levels include castles, monasteries, an opera house, Venice, graveyards, and more. Monsters are also very different, with new ones almost every level.</p>
